## 🚀 Overview

Password Manager Pro is a **secure web application** that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their credentials safely. All sensitive data is encrypted before storage using strong cryptographic practices.

Designed with both **security and performance in mind**, the application handles large datasets efficiently while maintaining a clean, modern interface.

---

## ⚡ Features

* **User Authentication** — Session-based login system using secure middleware
* **Strong Key Derivation** — PBKDF2-HMAC with **`600,000 iterations`**
* **AES Encryption (Fernet)** — Passwords encrypted before storage
* **Password Management** — Add, view, and delete credentials
* **Password Strength Checker** — Built-in analysis tool
* **Modern UI** — Glassmorphism + cyber-style interface with animations
* **Persistent Sessions** — Users stay logged in securely
* **API + Web Hybrid** — REST endpoints + Jinja-rendered frontend

## 🔑 Security Design

* Passwords are **never stored in plaintext**
* Encryption handled using **Fernet (AES-based symmetric encryption)**
* Keys derived using **PBKDF2-HMAC with 600,000 iterations**
* Each user has a uniquely derived encryption key
* Session-based authentication using secure middleware

---

## 🧪 Performance

* Tested with **1000+ stored passwords**
* Minimal latency under load
* Efficient database queries via SQLAlchemy

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

* Building full-stack apps using FastAPI
* Designing secure authentication systems
* Implementing encryption & key derivation properly
* Structuring scalable backend systems with routers
* Creating polished UI with modern CSS techniques
